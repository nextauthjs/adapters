## Overview

This is the Upstash Redis adapter for [`next-auth`](https://next-auth.js.org). This package can only be used in conjunction with the primary `next-auth` and `@upstash/redis` packages. It is not a standalone package.

## Getting Started

1. Install `next-auth` and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` as well as `@upstash/redis` via NPM.

```js
npm install next-auth @next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter @upstash/redis
```

2. Add the follwing code to your `pages/api/[...nextauth].js` next-auth configuration object.

```js
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import UpstashRedisAdapter from "@next-auth/upstash-adapter"
import upstashRedisClient from "@upstash/redis"

const redis = upstashRedisClient("UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL", "UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN")

// For more information on each option (and a full list of options) go to
// https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options
export default NextAuth({
  ...
  adapter: UpstashRedisAdapter(redis)
  ...
})
```

## Using Multiple Apps with a Single Upstash Redis Instance

The Upstash free-tier allows for only one Redis instance. If you have multiple Next-Auth connected apps using this instance, you need different key prefixes for every app.

You can change the prefixes by passing an `options` object as the second argument to the adapter factory function.

The default values for this object are:

```js
const defaultOptions = {
  baseKeyPrefix: "",
  accountKeyPrefix: "user:account:",
  accountByUserIdPrefix: "user:account:by-user-id:",
  emailKeyPrefix: "user:email:",
  sessionKeyPrefix: "user:session:",
  sessionByUserIdKeyPrefix: "user:session:by-user-id:",
  userKeyPrefix: "user:",
  verificationTokenKeyPrefix: "user:token:",
}
```

Usually changing the `baseKeyPrefix` should be enough for this scenario, but for more custom setups, you can also change the prefixes of every single key.

Example:

```js
export default NextAuth({
  ...
  adapter: UpstashRedisAdapter(redis, {baseKeyPrefix: "app2:"})
  ...
})
```
