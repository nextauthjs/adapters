# Prisma (Legacy) Adapter

This is kept for backwards compatibility reasons.

If you start a new project, we recommend testing out `@next-auth/prisma-adapter` instead.

Check it out at https://github.com/nextauthjs/adapters/tree/main/packages/prisma

## Usage

This adapter ships with the `next-auth` core package in versions below `4.0.0`. Separate documentation for this can be found [here](https://next-auth.js.org/adapters/prisma-legacy).
